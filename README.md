## Overview
### AdaPPI: Identification of novel protein functional modules via adaptive Graph Convolution Networks in a protein-protein interaction network, 2022
Here we provide the implementation of the AdaPPI method , along with an execution example (on the Krogan-core dataset). The repository is organized as follows:
+ `dataset/` contains the PPI network dataset file;
+ `evaluator/` contains the evaluations of protein functional modules (`compare_performance.py`);
+ `model/` contains:
  + the implementation of the adaptive graph convolution network based on core-attachment method (`adappi_model.py`);
  + the implementation of AGC based on core-attachment method(`protein_agc_model.py`);
  + the implementation of the core-attachment method(`core_attachment.py`);
  + `adappi/` contains:
    + the implementation of self-supervision in loss function (`loss_estimator.py`);
    + the implementation of the adaptive graph convolution network (`repres_learner.py`);
    + preparing to train the adaptive graph convolution network (`trainer.py`);
+ `util/` contains data preprocessing of PPI network dataset (`data_processor.py`);
+ `supplementary_files/` contains the p-value of (predicted but unmatched) potential candidate protein functional modules in two tables calculated by [GOTermFinder](https://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermFinder) tool.

Finally, `model/adappi_model.py` sets all hyperparameters and may be used to execute a full training run on PPI network dataset.

```bash
$ python model/adappi_model.py
```
